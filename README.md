The project focuses on the following concepts and features:

1. Input/output data handling
2. Variable declaration and data types
3. Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
4. Looping structures (for, while)
5. Function declaration and definition
6. Multi-file program organization

To use the Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Build and compile the source files using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform arithmetic operations using the calculator.

The Calculator project includes the following features:

Addition: Perform addition of two numbers.<br/>
Subtraction: Perform subtraction of two numbers.<br/>
Multiplication: Perform multiplication of two numbers.<br/>
